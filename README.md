## About

This prototype was developed as a showcase of my skills in Java, JavaFX, and JNativeHook. It demonstrates how to capture mouse events and manipulate JavaFX UI components to create a simple user interaction.

Please note that this is just a prototype, and it serves as a foundation for future development with additional features and improvements.

## Features

- Click the middle mouse button and move the mouse to the arc shape to take a screenshot.
- The arc shape will turn red when the mouse is inside the upper half and at a distance greater than 5 pixels.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to enhance this prototype application by adding more customizable options and features. Some of the potential improvements include:

- Allowing users to configure their own shortcuts and actions.
- Enhancing the user interface for a more polished look.
- Adding support for capturing custom key combinations.
- Saving the user's preferences and settings.
- Integrating with other external APIs or services.
