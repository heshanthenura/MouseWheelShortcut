# Mouse Wheel Shortcut - Prototype

Mouse Wheel Shortcut is a simple prototype application that demonstrates a basic mouse wheel shortcut functionality with JavaFX and JNativeHook. The application allows you to take a screenshot by following these steps:

1. Press the middle mouse button.
2. Move the mouse to the arc shape on the screen.
3. Release the middle mouse button to trigger the screenshot capture.
4. The screenshot will be saved in the "Pictures" folder.

## About

This prototype was developed as a showcase of my skills in Java, JavaFX, and JNativeHook. It demonstrates how to capture mouse events and manipulate JavaFX UI components to create a simple user interaction.

Please note that this is just a prototype, and it serves as a foundation for future development with additional features and improvements.

## Features

- Click the middle mouse button and move the mouse to the arc shape to take a screenshot.
